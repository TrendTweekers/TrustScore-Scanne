# TrustScore Scanner - Shopify App Store Listing

## App Name
TrustScore Scanner & Audit

## Tagline
TrustScore Scanner — The AI-powered trust audit that diagnoses why visitors don't buy and recovers 15–35% of lost conversions for Shopify stores.

## Key Benefits
*   **Increase Sales**: Identify and fix the "red flags" that cause 98% of visitors to leave without buying.

## Description
**Why aren't they buying?** It's the #1 question for store owners. Usually, the answer is **Trust**.

TrustScore Scanner acts as a "mystery shopper" for your store. It analyzes over 20+ trust signals—from contact info and return policies to image quality and social proof—and gives you a simple 0-100 score.

But we don't just give you a number. We tell you exactly **how to fix it**.

## Core Problem

Stores with poor trust signals see 20–40% higher cart abandonment (Baymard Institute). Merchants lose $18–$75 per visitor who abandons due to low trust.

### Features
*   **Instant Audit**: Scan your store in seconds.
*   **Actionable Checklist**: Get a prioritized list of fixes (High/Medium/Low impact).
*   **Score History**: Track your improvements over time.
*   **Drop Alerts**: Get notified if your trust score drops (e.g., broken images, missing badges).
*   **AI Analysis (Pro)**: Get a human-like critique of your store's "vibe" and professionalism.

## AI Example

Our AI analyzes your store and surfaces insights like:

> *"Your homepage hero image is high quality, but your product pages lack social proof. Adding 10+ reviews and a trust badge above the fold could meaningfully improve purchase confidence."*
